Just one point about the first task, since you are already started
working on it. When I said APT-based I think the most important part
would be to identify components (programs or libraries) which are
not installed by an official repository. 
So, two things:
 1. APT can tell you which package installed which file. 
    So, if you have any binaries or libraries (e.g., under /usr/lib)
    which do not come from a package.. those are interesting files.
 2. If a file comes from a package but the package is not part of the 
    repositories in /etc/atp/sources -> it means it was manually installed,
    and it wont be automatically updated. Again, this is an interesting 
    target.
Everything else we don't care, as it is managed by the packer manager
and updated by it.
===============================
- We should consider both Linux and Windows
   * In linux the packer manager provides lots of information. Also man
     pages and git directories can be useful.
   * In windows, the registry, the file path, as well as icons and entries
     in the menu can be very valuable sources of information.
     Maybe also the browser log can be useful to see which program was
     downloaded
- In the two cases, the goal is to find which programs/libraries are present on disk.
- Then, for each program we should be able to tell if it is the last version and
  when the last version was released (i.e., if the software seems to still be
  maintained).
  There are several ways to do that:
    * By somehow extracting the version of the program and comparing with
      the last available on the web
    * By extracting the compilation date of the binary and comparing with
      the release date of the last available on the web
    * (in collaboration with Symantec) by checking if others users have
      the same program with a different hash but installed more recently
