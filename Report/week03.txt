# Weekly report: 04
## Dates: 16-26, Mar 2017
-------------------------

## Topic
+ Extract information by GIT method.

## Progress
+ Confirmed the reliability of Modify datetime to be considered
as Compiled datetime: DONE.

+ Extract information from git directories in the system: DONE.
  Extracted information: 
    Directory_path, 
    git_url, 
    branch:commit_id,
    latest_tag:commit_id.

+ List up all directory that contains autotool files: DONE.
  (configure.ac, Makefile.am)
  => These folders might be interesting.

## Challenges (or Notes)
+ Which will be considered the latest version of a software 
downloaded by git: the latest commit on master branch or the 
latest tagged version?
=> In many softwares, they don't create tags, so the latest 
commit on master branch will be considered the latest SW 
version.
=> However, this is related to the later step.

+ With information extracted from `interesting files` (previous
step), how can we determine those files are latest version or
not.
=> Maybe building the catalogue of SW with all of those information
(Program name, version, installed files, hash, datetimes,..) is
ncessary.

## Plan
+ Confirm the feasibility of building the catalog of programs 
with all of information about: VERSION, FILES, HASH, COMPILATION 
DATE.
