## Topic
+ Extract version info of files in interesting list

## Progress
+ Extract information from filesystem: done.

  Detail: Currently, haven't found a way to extract `version
  info` from a library file or a directory which contains
  the file.

  Instead, tried to extract following information:

	`Modify datetime, Size, MD5Sum, Build ID`

  with an assumption that modify datetime could be the 
  compilation date of the file.

  Tried to study the .gnu_version info when `readelf
  -V` a library, but it seems to be nothing related to
  version of the program/library.

## Challenges (or Notes)
+ Some program installed a bunch of files (many 
libraries) in a directory, not just ONLY ONE file.

+ Version showed in library name sometimes is not matched 
with actual version reported by Package Manager.

## Plan
+ Extract information by GIT method.
